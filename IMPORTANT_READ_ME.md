# P3_IP_MINI_PROJECT

The code and outputs with Book in the title is made and designed from the theory presented in:
Introduction to Video and Image Processing by Thomas B. Moeslund. 
The equations used can be found in chapter 3.3.1 on page 36(see also figure 1), and it has a deeper explanation in Appendix D.
The code and outputs with Book in the title are the main focus of this mini project, for more on this see the mini project report

The code and outputs with Web in the title is mearly adapted by me, and are not designed by me.
The source code can be found here:

This code and its outputs are used in the report to discuss the flaws in my program, see the report for more on this.
